        <h2>Hi there, and welcome to Quietly Thriving.</h2>
        <p>
          <br /> <br />
          After years of studying business, I started my career in the corporate
          world in Denmark. But a few years in human resources on the pursue to
          climb the corporate ladder, I realized that world wasn’t meant for me.
          <br /> <br />
          In 2016 I left the corporate world, with no plan B, just a strong
          intuitive feeling, that something else was out there waiting for me.
          <br /> <br />
          I bought a one-way ticket to Spain, to take a year off to study more
          and learn the language. Now, 4,5 years later I am still living and
          thriving in the Southern European culture.
          <br /> <br />
          The years passing by in Spain, contained many ups and downs, and many
          different jobs along the way. All of them to confirm and enhance my
          strong intuitive feeling, that something just still wasn’t right.
          <br /> <br />
          This started a long journey of self-reflection and self-discovery,
          which led me to understand, that for so long I had blamed my
          introverted nature for being the reason why I couldn’t get to where I
          wanted to be. That was so wrong! The real issue was that I had
          constantly been trying to live a life that wasn’t aligned with my true
          self.
          <br /> <br />I made a promise to myself, to no longer pretend and hide
          myself. The journey did not only teach me to accept and appreciate my
          quiet nature, it also led the way for my career. I found my way of
          combining my corporate experience with my passion, and I am now on a
          mission to help other quiet women to unapologetically live a life
          that’s aligned with who they truly are.
