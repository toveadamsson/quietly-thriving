That was so wrong! The real issue was that I had\n            constantly been trying to live a life that wasn’t aligned with my\n            true self.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I made a promise to myself, to no longer pretend and hide myself.\n            The journey did not only teach me to accept and appreciate my quiet\n            nature, it also led the way for my career. I found my way of\n            combining my corporate experience with my passion, and I am now on a\n            mission to help other quiet women to unapologetically live a life\n            that’s aligned with who they truly are.\n          </p> */}\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"links\">\n          <p>\n            If you are interested in knowing more on how to work with me, you\n            can book a first free 30 minutes call.
